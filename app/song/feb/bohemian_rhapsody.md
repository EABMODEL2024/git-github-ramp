## Songfacts

1. The song was written by Freddie Mercury, who composed it on the piano and used various musical styles, such as ballad, opera, hard rock and rockabilly. He also wrote the lyrics, which are about a man who confesses to a murder and faces the consequences.

2. The song was recorded in various studios between August and September 1975, with extensive overdubbing and multi-tracking. The band used up to 180 vocal tracks for the operatic section, creating a “wall of sound” effect. The song also features a guitar solo by Brian May and a gong hit by Roger Taylor at the end.

3. The song was released as a single on 31 October 1975, with “I’m in Love with My Car” as the B-side1. It was initially met with skepticism by the record company and some critics, who thought it was too long and complex for radio play. However, it became a huge success after being championed by DJ Kenny Everett, who played it repeatedly on his show. It topped the UK Singles Chart for nine weeks and became the UK’s third best-selling single of all time. It also reached number one in several other countries and number nine in the US.

4. The song was accompanied by a promotional video, which is considered one of the first and most influential music videos ever made. It was directed by Bruce Gowers and featured the band miming to the song in a darkened studio, using special effects and lighting. The video was based on a photo of the band by Mick Rock, inspired by Marlene Dietrich2. The video helped popularise the song and the medium of music video, as it was shown on various TV shows around the world.
