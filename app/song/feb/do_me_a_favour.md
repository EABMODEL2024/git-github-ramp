This song describes a tempestuous breakup while driving a girl home. Alex Turner has admitted it came from personal experience. He tells NME: "It's about a goodbye, really, and about me being a bit of a knob. Perhaps I were craving to experience something else and looking back and feeling like you were a bit of a knobhead, just in how you perhaps treated that person. It's just describing a goodbye. That's another thing, when you're with someone they seem happier in photos before you met her, or happier in stories from before. I always think they do."
